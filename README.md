**`Level 2 Code Wizard`**

I'm an aspiring software developer, with a focus on game engine development, although I like playing around with whatever I find interesting at the time, be it machine learning or web application development.
I've recently done a career shift into the world of Computer Science, having previously worked as a geophysicist.
All my coding projects can be found here.
